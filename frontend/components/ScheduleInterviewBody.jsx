    Congratulations! After reviewing your application, we decide to move forward with you!
    For the next step, we hope to have a one-hour meeting through a virtual call to learn
    more about you. When you have a moment, please let us know when youâ€™d be available
    for the call, as well as the number to best reach you. Shortly after you submit your
    availability, our team will review your request and our availability, and will confirm
    the time and date for the call.
